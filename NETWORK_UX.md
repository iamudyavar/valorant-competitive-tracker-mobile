# Network UX Improvements

## Overview
The mobile app now features an improved network experience that shows a persistent banner at the bottom of the screen instead of hiding all content when the network connection is lost.

## Key Features

### NetworkBanner Component
- **Global Positioning**: Appears at the bottom of all screens with proper safe area spacing (above tab bar)
- **Offline Only**: Only shows banner when completely offline (no slow connection warnings)
- **Contextual Messages**: Different messages based on connection type:
  - No connection: "You're currently offline. Please check your internet connection."
  - Server unreachable: "Unable to connect to the server. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Non-intrusive**: Content remains visible while the banner is shown
- **Auto-show/hide**: Banner automatically appears when going offline and disappears when online
- **No dismissal**: Banner persists until network is restored (simplified UX)

### Global Implementation
- **Layout Level**: Banner is rendered at the root layout level (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- **Always Present**: No need to add banner to individual pages
- **Consistent**: Same behavior across all screens automatically

## Implementation Details

### Global Layout Integration
- **Root Layout** (`app/_layout.tsx`): NetworkBanner is rendered globally
- **All Pages**: Automatically inherit the banner without individual implementation
- **Safe Area**: Proper bottom safe area handling for tab bar and home indicator

### Behavior
1. **App Launch**: If offline on launch, shows full-screen offline state (unchanged)
2. **Network Loss**: While using the app, shows persistent banner at bottom (above tab bar)
3. **Network Recovery**: Banner automatically disappears when connection is restored
4. **Slow Connections**: No banner shown - only loading states with no retry buttons
5. **Always Visible**: Banner appears on all screens when completely offline

## Benefits
- **Better UX**: Users can still see and interact with cached content
- **Less Disruptive**: No sudden disappearance of all content
- **Simplified**: No user interaction required - banner manages itself
- **Contextual**: Different messages for different network conditions
- **Consistent**: Same behavior across all pages automatically
- **Clean Code**: No need to implement banner in each page

## Technical Notes
- Banner uses absolute positioning at bottom with high z-index
- Positioned above tab bar with `bottom: insets.bottom + 50` for proper spacing
- Only shows for offline states (no slow connection warnings)
- Removed "Try again" buttons from slow connection loading states
- Global implementation reduces code duplication
- Shadow effect points upward for bottom positioning
